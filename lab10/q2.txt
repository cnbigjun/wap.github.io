1.Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?

setTimeout runs in the timers phase,setImmediate runs in the check phase.
In Node.js, if setImmediate and setTimeout(fn, 0) are called in the main module, their execution order is unpredictable as it depends on the exact state of the event loop.
However, if setImmediate and setTimeout(fn, 0) are called inside an I/O cycle, Node.js guarantees that callbacks from setImmediate will always execute before those from setTimeout.
Therefore, you should use setImmediate when you want to ensure that your callback executes as soon as possible and takes precedence over other I/O events. You should use setTimeout if you want to allow time for other I/O events to process.

2.Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?

process.nextTick callbacks run immediately after the current operation completes- highest priotiry, while setImmediate callbacks run after all I/O events callbacks and timers have fired.

3.Does Node.js has window object?

No
